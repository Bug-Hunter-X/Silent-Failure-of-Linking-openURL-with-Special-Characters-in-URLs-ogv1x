This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to open a URL in a custom browser, and the URL contains special characters.  The `Linking.openURL` function might fail silently, without providing any error messages. This is especially problematic when debugging, as it's hard to pinpoint the source of the failure.  For example, if the URL contains a '+' character representing a space, it may be incorrectly interpreted.
